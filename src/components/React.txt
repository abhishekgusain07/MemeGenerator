1. what is a "side effect" in React ? what are examples
=> any code that affects an outside system.
=> local storage, API, websockets, two states to keep in sync


2. what is NOT a "side effect" in React? examples.
=> anything that React is in charge of
=> maintaining state, keeping the UI in sync with the data, render DOM element


3. When does React run your useEffect function? when does it not run the effect function ?
=> As soon as the component loads (first render)
=> On every re-render of the component (assuming no dependencies array)
=> will NOT run the effect when the values of the dependencies in the array stay the same between renders

4. how would you explain what the "dependencies array" is ?
=> second parameter to the useEffect function
=> so the value in dependencies array is compared to its own previous state if there is change in any sense then the useEffect function runs.
